## Sprint Goal
For our first sprint, we started the development of the project by creating a rough sketch of the database and the architecture, as well as starting the development of the frontend and backend of the project, by completing our epic ["MM-58: Product Management"](https://es-proj.atlassian.net/browse/MM-58?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMjliMDhjOTBlNzEyNDg0Zjg5Nzk0M2Q1ZTdlY2Q3YzAiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).
