## Sprint Review

The completion of Sprint 5 marks a significant milestone in our project, as we successfully achieved the sprint goal of implementing critical User Stories and completed the first major cycle of development for our product.

The integration of third-party authentication was a pending issue lasting multiple sprints and the team had to address issues related to API compatibility and security protocols. Another significant challenge was the implementation of the photo upload feature. We encountered several errors when connecting to AWS services, which hindered our progress. However, through persistent troubleshooting and leveraging the expertise of our team members, we successfully resolved these issues. 

The experiences of this development cycle have provided us with valuable insights into the resilience and adaptability of our team and as individuals. As we move forward, the lessons learned will be instrumental in guiding our approach to future challenges. Moreover, the team also deepened our appreciation for the Scrum values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. Each team member's dedication to these principles has been pivotal in our ability to meet every sprint goal and conclude development of our solution.
