# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) consists of defining whenever a task is ready to be executed by the development team. 

Without criteria set by the DoR, the team should not start a task in the backlog.

### Small

The defined user stories should be as small as possible and be individual from each other.

### Independent

The defined user stories should be independent from each other, as in, a change in one user story should not affect the development or readiness of another.

### Testable

All user stories should be testable, as in there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. The acceptance criteria should assure that each user story is testable.

### Estimated Cost

All user stories should have an estimated cost, as in, the cost of implementation of each story. Our costs are based in the following fibonacci scale.

| Story Points | Effort Required | Time Required | 
| :--: | :-------------: | :-----------: | 
| 1 | Mininum effort | A few minutes | 
| 2 | Mininum effort | A few hours | 
| 3 | Mild effort | A day | 
| 5 | Moderate effort | A few days | 
| 8 | Severe effort | A week | 
| 13 | Maximun effort | A month | 

Our backlog is also sorted in order of importance, as in, the first elements in the backlog are our priority and consist of the most value to the user. Therefore, our sprints encompass the first elements available in the backlog.
