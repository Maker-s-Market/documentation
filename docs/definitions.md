# Definitions

## Definition of Done

The definition of done (DoD) is when all conditions or acceptance criteria that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by the user or software customer. 

It is necessary to ensure software quality, since user stories which don't met these criteria are not promoted to the final increment.
