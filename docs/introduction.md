# Introduction

A small description of our project, **Maker's Market**, and how it is being developed.

## Value Proposal

Due to limited knowledge and lack of online visibility, many sellers suffer from the pain of not being able to sell their products to a wider audience, ending up resorting to local neighbours as their only sellers.

Maker's Market is an online platform that allows users and sellers to connect with each other, and expand the commerce of local businesses and artisan products.
Sellers can advertise their product and reach consumers on the whole platform, therefore increasing their online visibility, without needing to set up their own commerce platforms.

Our project is being developed using the **[Jira Framework](https://es-proj.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MM/boards/1)**, using the agile methodology and scrum, where valuable increments are done each sprint and always produce working software.
